## DS/MLE Candidate Take-Home Assessment
This repository contains the take-home assessment tasks for Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer candidates.

### Tasks Overview
The assessment consists of two distinct tasks, designed to evaluate a range of advanced skills in Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models.

#### Advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

*   Description: Implement and evaluate a RAG system using hierarchical chunking, an on-disk vector database, and a small language model, focusing on resource-constrained environments.

*   Solution: [`rag/README.md`](rag/README.md)
#### LLM Finetuning (PEFT Comparison)

*   Description: Finetune a small language model using two different Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, comparing their performance, resource consumption, and discussing potential generalization.
*   Solution: [`finetuning/README.md`](finetuning/README.md)
